# BestKabu Browser Extension
A Simple Browser extension that makes Digikabu.de better. This is a Fork of [@ouihq](https://github.com/ouihq/betterKabu)

## Autologin
**Be aware that the credentials are currently stored unencryped!**
To set your credentials, open the extension on the digikabu.de website and type your username and password, then press on the Save Login Button. To enable it, click the checkbox and press on the Save Login Button and refresh the page. If there is no username or password, the credentials won't be overwritten!

## Colorpicker
To change the color of the highlighting: Open the Extension on the digikabu.de webite and enter a HEX code in the input field. If you don't know them from memory, click on the link and copy the HEX code from there. A HEX code is always a "#" and 6 digets that can be "0,1,2,...9, A, B, C, D, E, F".

## Goal:
We want to make Digikabu a better and more beautiful place for students with features like:
- Timer
- Darkmode
- Highlighting for current day

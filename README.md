# BetterKabu Browser Extension

## Manuelle Installation
1. Downloade the repository
2. Open your web browser and click on the three dots in the top right corner to open the browser's menu. From there, select "More tools" and then "Extensions" (or "Add-ons" in some browsers).
3. In the Extensions page, make sure that the "Developer mode" toggle switch is turned on. This will enable you to install extensions that are not available in the browser's official extension marketplace.
4. Next, click on the "Load unpacked" button. This will open a file explorer window.
5. Navigate to the extracted zip file location and select the folder that contains the extension's source code.
6. Click "Select folder" to load the extension into your browser.
7. Finally, check that the extension is installed and working correctly by looking for its icon in your browser's toolbar or by testing its functionality.

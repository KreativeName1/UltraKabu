# BestKabu Browser Extension
A Simple Browser extension that makes Digikabu.de better. This is a Fork of [@ouihq](https://github.com/ouihq/betterKabu)

# (Version < 2.0.0) is unstable, use on your own risk

## Autologin
**with encryption**:
To set your credentials, open the extension on the digikabu.de website and type your username, password and an encryption key (a key longer than the credentials is useless) and check the "Enable Password Protection" Button, then press on the Save Login Button. To enable it, click the checkbox and press on the "Save Login" Button and refresh the page. If there is no username or password, the credentials won't be overwritten! If you want to login, click on the Extension, and type your encryption key and then on login.

**without encryption**:
To set your credentials, open the extension on the digikabu.de website and type your username and password, then press on the "Save Login" Button. To enable it, click the checkbox and press on the "Save Login" Button and refresh the page. If there is no username or password, the credentials won't be overwritten!

## Colorpicker
To change the color of the highlighting: Open the Extension on the digikabu.de website and enter a HEX code in the input field. If you don't know them from memory, click on the link and copy the HEX code from there. A HEX code is always a "#" and 6 digits, that can be "0,1,2,...9, A, B, C, D, E, F".

## Current features:
- Dark mode toggle
- Autologin
- Custom highlighting
- Time remaining until the next lesson

## Chromium based special
If you use the Extension from Github for chromium based browsers, use the "chromium-changes" branch instead of main. Because there are custom modifications for those browsers.
